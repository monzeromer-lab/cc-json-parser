# JSON Parser - Coding Challenge by JOHN CRICKETT

This repository contains an implementation of a JSON parser, written in Rust. This project is a part of my ongoing journey to enhance my Rust programming skills and delve into parsing techniques.

## Important Note

I'll get to this project later, It's not done yet.

## About JSON Parser

The JSON parser is a tool that reads JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and extracts information or performs specific operations based on the structure of the JSON data.

## About this Implementation

This JSON parser is implemented in Rust, a language I am actively learning..

## Features

- Parses JSON data and validate it only

## Usage

```bash
cc-json-parser -- filename.json
```

## Note

As I'm currently using Windows, there might be limited or no support for standard input in this implementation. Feel free to explore and adapt the code accordingly for your specific use case.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monzeromer-lab/cc-json-parser.git
cd cc-json-parser
```

2.Build the JSON parser:

```bash
cargo build
```

3.Run the JSON parser:

```bash
cargo run -- filename.json
```

Feel free to explore, Happy coding!
